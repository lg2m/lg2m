Hi, I'm Zach and I'm a software engineer that enjoys learning new things, this includes a number of topics such as: reverse engineering, game development, programming languages, infrastructure, and much more.

- At work, my current focus is on improving data management systems and the infrastructure supporting model training at scale.
- In my free time, I tend to tinker and build random things - currently that is a game that is _slowly_ being worked on.

### Technical Stack

- Rust
- Python
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- React.js / Next.js
